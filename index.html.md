*Claudette* is a wrapper for Anthropic’s [Python
SDK](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python).

The SDK works well, but it is quite low level – it leaves the developer
to do a lot of stuff manually. That’s a lot of extra work and
boilerplate! Claudette automates pretty much everything that can be
automated, whilst providing full control. Amongst the features provided:

- A [`Chat`](https://claudette.answer.ai/core.html#chat) class that
  creates stateful dialogs
- Support for *prefill*, which tells Claude what to use as the first few
  words of its response
- Convenient image support
- Simple and convenient support for Claude’s new Tool Use API.

You’ll need to set the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable to the
key provided to you by Anthropic in order to use this library.

Note that this library is the first ever “literate nbdev” project. That
means that the actual source code for the library is a rendered Jupyter
Notebook which includes callout notes and tips, HTML tables and images,
detailed explanations, and teaches *how* and *why* the code is written
the way it is. Even if you’ve never used the Anthropic Python SDK or
Claude API before, you should be able to read the source code. Click
[Claudette’s Source](https://claudette.answer.ai/core.html) to read it,
or clone the git repo and execute the notebook yourself to see every
step of the creation process in action. The tutorial below includes
links to API details which will take you to relevant parts of the
source. The reason this project is a new kind of literal program is
because we take seriously Knuth’s call to action, that we have a “*moral
commitment*” to never write an “*illiterate program*” – and so we have a
commitment to making literate programming an easy and pleasant
experience. (For more on this, see [this
talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX1yGxJijsI) from Hamel Husain.)

## Install

``` sh
pip install claudette
```

## Getting started

Anthropic’s Python SDK will automatically be installed with Claudette,
if you don’t already have it.

``` python
import os
# os.environ['ANTHROPIC_LOG'] = 'debug'
```

To print every HTTP request and response in full, uncomment the above
line.

``` python
from claudette import *
```

Claudette only exports the symbols that are needed to use the library,
so you can use `import *` to import them. Alternatively, just use:

``` python
import claudette
```

…and then add the prefix `claudette.` to any usages of the module.

Claudette provides `models`, which is a list of models currently
available from the SDK.

``` python
models
```

    ['claude-opus-4-5',
     'claude-sonnet-4-5',
     'claude-haiku-4-5',
     'claude-opus-4-1-20250805',
     'claude-opus-4-20250514',
     'claude-3-opus-20240229',
     'claude-sonnet-4-20250514',
     'claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219',
     'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022',
     'claude-3-haiku-20240307']

For these examples, we’ll use Sonnet 4, since it’s awesome!

``` python
model = models[1]
model
```

    'claude-sonnet-4-5'

## Chat

The main interface to Claudette is the
[`Chat`](https://claudette.answer.ai/core.html#chat) class, which
provides a stateful interface to Claude:

``` python
chat = Chat(model, sp="""You are a helpful and concise assistant.""")
chat("I'm Jeremy")
```

Hello Jeremy! Nice to meet you. How can I help you today?

<details>

- id: `msg_01SUuWHAbhHJLDj4ZZXQRkko`
- content:
  `[{'citations': None, 'text': 'Hello Jeremy! Nice to meet you. How can I help you today?', 'type': 'text'}]`
- model: `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`
- role: `assistant`
- stop_reason: `end_turn`
- stop_sequence: `None`
- type: `message`

  `{'cache_creation': {'ephemeral_1h_input_tokens': 0, 'ephemeral_5m_input_tokens': 0}, 'cache_creation_input_tokens': 0, 'cache_read_input_tokens': 0, 'input_tokens': 19, 'output_tokens': 18, 'server_tool_use': None, 'service_tier': 'standard'}`

</details>

``` python
r = chat("What's my name?")
r
```

Your name is Jeremy!

<details>

- id: `msg_01V2Udc8rdipXa3sKtPDsAmz`

</details>

``` python
r = chat("What's my name?")
r
```

Your name is Jeremy! Is there something I can help you with?

<details>

- id: `msg_01Hjj5FEtToCFizRVxuGKeC8`
- content:
  `[{'citations': None, 'text': 'Your name is Jeremy! Is there something I can help you with?', 'type': 'text'}]`

</details>

As you see above, displaying the results of a call in a notebook shows
just the message contents, with the other details hidden behind a
collapsible section. Alternatively you can `print` the details:

``` python
print(r)
```

    Message(id='msg_01Hjj5FEtToCFizRVxuGKeC8', content=[TextBlock(citations=None, text='Your name is Jeremy! Is there something I can help you with?', type='text')], model='claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929', role='assistant', stop_reason='end_turn', stop_sequence=None, type='message', usage=In: 61; Out: 17; Cache create: 0; Cache read: 0; Total Tokens: 78; Search: 0)

Claude supports adding an extra `assistant` message at the end, which
contains the *prefill* – i.e. the text we want Claude to assume the
response starts with. Let’s try it out:

``` python
chat("Concisely, what is the meaning of life?",
     prefill='According to Douglas Adams,')
```

According to Douglas Adams, it’s 42.

More seriously: finding purpose through connections with others,
personal growth, and contributing something meaningful - though the
specific answer is deeply personal to each individual.

</details>

You can add `stream=True` to stream the results as soon as they arrive
(although you will only see the gradual generation if you execute the
notebook yourself, of course!)

``` python
for o in chat("Concisely, what book was that in?", prefill='It was in', stream=True):
    print(o, end='')
```

    It was in "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" by Douglas Adams.

### Async

Alternatively, you can use
[`AsyncChat`](https://claudette.answer.ai/async.html#asyncchat) (or
[`AsyncClient`](https://claudette.answer.ai/async.html#asyncclient)) for
the async versions, e.g:

``` python
chat = AsyncChat(model)
await chat("I'm Jeremy")
```

Hello Jeremy! Nice to meet you. How can I help you today?

<details>

- id: `msg_01QJE9fQnqQNGEuzNPqQ6pHG`
- content:
  `[{'citations': None, 'text': 'Hello Jeremy! Nice to meet you. How can I help you today?', 'type': 'text'}]`
- model: `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`
- role: `assistant`
- stop_reason: `end_turn`
- stop_sequence: `None`
- type: `message`
- usage:
  `{'cache_creation': {'ephemeral_1h_input_tokens': 0, 'ephemeral_5m_input_tokens': 0}, 'cache_creation_input_tokens': 0, 'cache_read_input_tokens': 0, 'input_tokens': 10, 'output_tokens': 18, 'server_tool_use': None, 'service_tier': 'standard'}`

</details>

Remember to use `async for` when streaming in this case:

``` python
async for o in await chat("Concisely, what is the meaning of life?",
                          prefill='According to Douglas Adams,', stream=True):
    print(o, end='')
```

    According to Douglas Adams,  it's 42.

    More seriously: there's no universal answer. Common perspectives include:
    - **Creating meaning** through relationships, work, and experiences
    - **Reducing suffering** and increasing wellbeing (yours and others')
    - **Connection** - to people, nature, or something transcendent
    - **Growth** - becoming who you're capable of being

    The question might be less "What is the meaning?" and more "What meaning will you create?"

    What resonates with you?

## Prompt caching

Claude supports [prompt
caching](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching),
which can significantly reduce token usage costs when working with large
contexts or repetitive elements. When you use `mk_msg(msg, cache=True)`,
Claudette adds the necessary cache control headers to make that message
cacheable.

Prompt caching works by marking segments of your prompt for efficient
reuse. When a cached segment is encountered again, Claude reads it from
the cache rather than processing the full content, resulting in a 90%
reduction in token costs for those segments.

Some key points about prompt caching: - Cache writes cost 25% more than
normal input tokens - Cache reads cost 90% less than normal input
tokens - Minimum cacheable length is model-dependent (1024-2048
tokens) - Cached segments must be completely identical to be reused -
Works well for system prompts, tool definitions, and large context
blocks

For instance, here we use caching when asking about Claudette’s readme
file:

``` python
chat = Chat(model, sp="""You are a helpful and concise assistant.""")
```

``` python
nbtxt = Path('README.txt').read_text()
msg = f'''<README>
{nbtxt}
</README>
In brief, what is the purpose of this project based on the readme?'''
r = chat(mk_msg(msg, cache=True))
r
```

Claudette is a high-level wrapper for Anthropic’s Python SDK that
simplifies working with Claude AI. Its main purposes are to:

1.  **Automate boilerplate** - Handles repetitive tasks that would
    otherwise require manual coding with the base SDK
2.  **Provide stateful conversations** - Offers a
    [`Chat`](https://claudette.answer.ai/core.html#chat) class for
    maintaining dialog context
3.  **Simplify advanced features** - Makes it easier to use:
    - Tool/function calling
    - Image inputs
    - Prompt prefilling
    - Prompt caching
    - Structured data extraction
4.  **Support multiple providers** - Works with Anthropic’s API, AWS
    Bedrock, and Google Vertex

The project is also notable for being a “literate programming” example -
its source code is written as an educational Jupyter Notebook that
explains both how and why the code works, making it accessible even to
those unfamiliar with the Claude API.

The response records the a cache has been created using these input
tokens:

``` python
print(r.usage)
```

    Usage(cache_creation=CacheCreation(ephemeral_1h_input_tokens=0, ephemeral_5m_input_tokens=9288), cache_creation_input_tokens=9288, cache_read_input_tokens=0, input_tokens=3, output_tokens=210, server_tool_use=None, service_tier='standard')

We can now ask a followup question in this chat:

``` python
r = chat('How does it make tool use more ergonomic?')
r
```

Claudette makes tool use more ergonomic in several key ways:

## 1. **Simple Function Definitions with Docments**

You just write normal Python functions with type hints and comments -
Claudette automatically converts them into Claude’s tool format:

``` python
def sums(
    a:int,  # First thing to sum
    b:int=1 # Second thing to sum
) -> int: # The sum of the inputs
    "Adds a + b."
    return a + b
```

## 2. **Automatic Tool Execution**

When Claude requests a tool, Claudette automatically: - Detects the
tool_use response - Calls your Python function with the parameters -
Sends the result back to Claude - Returns the final answer

You just call `chat()` again and it handles everything behind the
scenes.

## 3. **Single-Step Multi-Tool Solving with `toolloop`**

Instead of manually managing back-and-forth tool calls, `toolloop`
automatically handles multiple tool invocations in one call:

``` python
chat.toolloop('Calculate (604542+6458932)*2')
# Automatically calls sums(), then mults(), then returns final answer
```

## 4. **Direct Structured Output**

For single-tool results,
[`Client.structured()`](https://claudette.answer.ai/core.html#client.structured)
gives you immediate output without conversation management:

``` python
cli.structured("What is 604542+6458932", sums)
# Returns: [7063474]
```

This eliminates all the manual tool schema definition, response parsing,
and execution logic required by the base SDK.

We can see that this only used ~200 regular input tokens – the 7000+
context tokens have been read from cache.

``` python
print(r.usage)
```

    Usage(cache_creation=CacheCreation(ephemeral_1h_input_tokens=0, ephemeral_5m_input_tokens=0), cache_creation_input_tokens=0, cache_read_input_tokens=9288, input_tokens=227, output_tokens=368, server_tool_use=None, service_tier='standard')

``` python
chat.use
```

## Tool use

[Tool use](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/tool-use) lets Claude
use external tools.

We use [docments](https://fastcore.fast.ai/docments.html) to make
defining Python functions as ergonomic as possible. Each parameter (and
the return value) should have a type, and a docments comment with the
description of what it is. As an example we’ll write a simple function
that adds numbers together, and will tell us when it’s being called:

``` python
def sums(
    a:int,  # First thing to sum
    b:int=1 # Second thing to sum
) -> int: # The sum of the inputs
    "Adds a + b."
    print(f"Finding the sum of {a} and {b}")
    return a + b
```

Sometimes Claude will try to add stuff up “in its head”, so we’ll use a
system prompt to ask it not to.

``` python
sp = "Always use tools if math ops are needed."
```

We’ll get Claude to add up some long numbers:

``` python
a,b = 604542,6458932
pr = f"What is {a}+{b}?"
pr
```

    'What is 604542+6458932?'

To use tools, pass a list of them to
[`Chat`](https://claudette.answer.ai/core.html#chat):

``` python
chat = Chat(model, sp=sp, tools=[sums])
```

To force Claude to always answer using a tool, set `tool_choice` to that
function name. When Claude needs to use a tool, it doesn’t return the
answer, but instead returns a `tool_use` message, which means we have to
call the named tool with the provided parameters.

``` python
r = chat(pr, tool_choice='sums')
r
```

Claudette handles all that for us – we just call it again, and it all
happens automatically:

``` python
chat()
```

</details>

You can see how many tokens have been used at any time by checking the
`use` property. Note that (as of May 2024) tool use in Claude uses a
*lot* of tokens, since it automatically adds a large system prompt.

``` python
chat.use
```

    In: 1428; Out: 77; Cache create: 0; Cache read: 0; Total Tokens: 1505; Search: 0

We can do everything needed to use tools in a single step, by using
[`Chat.toolloop`](https://claudette.answer.ai/toolloop.html#chat.toolloop).
This can even call multiple tools as needed solve a problem. For
example, let’s define a tool to handle multiplication:

``` python
def mults(
    a:int,  # First thing to multiply
    b:int=1 # Second thing to multiply
) -> int: # The product of the inputs
    "Multiplies a * b."
    print(f"Finding the product of {a} and {b}")
    return a * b
```

Now with a single call we can calculate `(a+b)*2` – by passing
`show_trace` we can see each response from Claude in the process:

``` python
chat = Chat(model, sp=sp, tools=[sums,mults])
pr = f'Calculate ({a}+{b})*2'
pr
```

    'Calculate (604542+6458932)*2'

``` python
for o in chat.toolloop(pr): display(o)
```

    Finding the sum of 604542 and 6458932

I’ll help you calculate (604542+6458932)\*2 by first adding the two
numbers, then multiplying the result by 2.

The answer is **14,126,948**.

To break it down: - 604542 + 6458932 = 7,063,474 - 7,063,474 × 2 =
14,126,948

## Structured data

If you just want the immediate result from a single tool, use
[`Client.structured`](https://claudette.answer.ai/core.html#client.structured).

``` python
cli = Client(model)
```

``` python
def sums(
    a:int,  # First thing to sum
    b:int=1 # Second thing to sum
) -> int: # The sum of the inputs
    "Adds a + b."
    print(f"Finding the sum of {a} and {b}")
    return a + b
```

``` python
cli.structured("What is 604542+6458932", sums)
```

    Finding the sum of 604542 and 6458932

    [7063474]

This is particularly useful for getting back structured information,
e.g:

``` python
class President:
    "Information about a president of the United States"
    def __init__(self, 
                first:str, # first name
                last:str, # last name
                spouse:str, # name of spouse
                years_in_office:str, # format: "{start_year}-{end_year}"
                birthplace:str, # name of city
                birth_year:int # year of birth, `0` if unknown
        ):
        assert re.match(r'\d{4}-\d{4}', years_in_office), "Invalid format: `years_in_office`"
        store_attr()

    __repr__ = basic_repr('first, last, spouse, years_in_office, birthplace, birth_year')
```

``` python
cli.structured("Provide key information about the 3rd President of the United States", President)
```

    [President(first='Thomas', last='Jefferson', spouse='Martha Wayles Skelton', years_in_office='1801-1809', birthplace='Shadwell', birth_year=1743)]

## Images

Claude can handle image data as well. As everyone knows, when testing
image APIs you have to use a cute puppy.

``` python
fn = Path('samples/puppy.jpg')
Image(filename=fn, width=200)
```

<img src="index_files/figure-commonmark/cell-35-output-1.jpeg"
width="200" />

We create a [`Chat`](https://claudette.answer.ai/core.html#chat) object
as before:

``` python
chat = Chat(model)
```

Claudette expects images as a list of bytes, so we read in the file:

``` python
img = fn.read_bytes()
```

Prompts to Claudette can be lists, containing text, images, or both, eg:

``` python
chat([img, "In brief, what color flowers are in this image?"])
```

The flowers in this image are **purple**.

</details>

The image is included as input tokens.

``` python
chat.use
```

    In: 110; Out: 12; Cache create: 0; Cache read: 0; Total Tokens: 122; Search: 0

Alternatively, Claudette supports creating a multi-stage chat with
separate image and text prompts. For instance, you can pass just the
image as the initial prompt (in which case Claude will make some general
comments about what it sees), and then follow up with questions in
additional prompts:

``` python
chat = Chat(model)
chat(img)
```

This is an adorable photo of a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel puppy! The
puppy has the breed’s characteristic features:

- **Blenheim coloring** - beautiful chestnut brown and white markings
- **Long, silky ears** with feathering
- **Large, expressive dark eyes** that give them their sweet, gentle
  appearance
- **White blaze** down the center of the face

The puppy is posed charmingly on grass with purple flowers (possibly
asters) in the background, creating a lovely garden setting. Cavalier
King Charles Spaniels are known for being affectionate, gentle, and
excellent companion dogs. This little one looks absolutely precious!

Is this your puppy, or are you just admiring this sweet photo?

``` python
chat('What direction is the puppy facing?')
```

The puppy is facing **directly toward the camera** (toward the viewer).
The puppy appears to be lying down with its head up, looking straight
ahead at whoever is taking the photograph. This frontal view gives us a
clear look at the puppy’s face, including both eyes, the white blaze
down the center of its face, and its adorable expression.

``` python
chat('What color is it?')
```

The puppy is **brown (chestnut) and white**.

Specifically: - The ears and patches around the eyes are a rich chestnut
brown/reddish-brown color - The face has white markings, including a
white blaze down the center - The visible parts of the body appear to be
predominantly white

This color pattern is called “Blenheim” in Cavalier King Charles
Spaniels - it’s one of the most popular and recognizable color
combinations for this breed.

Note that the image is passed in again for every input in the dialog, so
that number of input tokens increases quickly with this kind of chat.
(For large images, using prompt caching might be a good idea.)

## Extended Thinking

Claude \>=3.7 Sonnet and Opus have enhanced reasoning capabilities
through [extended
thinking](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking).
This feature allows Claude to think through complex problems
step-by-step, making its reasoning process transparent and its final
answers more reliable.

To enable extended thinking, simply specify the number of thinking
tokens using the `maxthinktok` parameter when making a call to Chat. The
thinking process will appear in a collapsible section in the response.

Some important notes about extended thinking:

- Only available with select models
- Automatically sets `temperature=1` when enabled (required for thinking
  to work)
- Cannot be used with `prefill` (these features are incompatible)
- Thinking is presented in a separate collapsible block in the response
- The thinking tokens count toward your usage but help with complex
  reasoning

To access models that support extended thinking, you can use
`has_extended_thinking_models`.

``` python
has_extended_thinking_models
```

    {'claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219',
     'claude-opus-4-1-20250805',
     'claude-opus-4-20250514',
     'claude-opus-4-5',
     'claude-sonnet-4-20250514',
     'haiku-4-5',
     'sonnet-4-5'}

``` python
chat = Chat(model)
```

``` python
chat('Write a sentence about Python!', maxthinktok=1024)
```

Python is a versatile, beginner-friendly programming language known for
its clean syntax and powerful applications in web development, data
science, automation, and artificial intelligence.

The user wants me to write a sentence about Python. Python could refer

general request without additional specifics, I’ll assume they mean the
programming language since that’s a common topic. I’ll write an
informative and positive sentence about it.

## Web Search and Server Tools

Claude supports server-side tools that run on Anthropic’s
infrastructure. The flagship example is the web search tool, which
allows Claude to search the web for up-to-date information to answer
questions.

Unlike client-side tools (where you provide functionality), server-side
tools are managed by Anthropic. Claudette makes these easy to use with
helper functions like
[`search_conf()`](https://claudette.answer.ai/core.html#search_conf).

``` python
chat = Chat(model, sp='Be concise in your responses.', tools=[search_conf()])
pr = 'What is the current weather in San Diego?'
r = chat(pr)
r
```

Based on current weather data for San Diego, CA:

**Current Conditions (December 2, 2024):** - Partly cloudy with a high
around 65°F [1] - Winds SW at 5 to 10 mph [2] - Low near 50°F with light
and variable winds [3]

The weather is pleasant with partly cloudy skies and mild temperatures
typical for San Diego in early December.

The [`search_conf()`](https://claudette.answer.ai/core.html#search_conf)
function creates the necessary configuration for the web search tool.
You can customize it with several parameters:

``` python
search_conf(
    max_uses=None,               # Maximum number of searches Claude can perform
    allowed_domains=None,        # List of domains to search within (e.g., ['wikipedia.org'])
    blocked_domains=None,        # List of domains to exclude (e.g., ['twitter.com'])
    user_location=None           # Location context for search
)
```

When Claude uses the web search tool, the response includes citations
linking to the source information. Claudette automatically formats these
citations and provides them as footnotes in the response.

Web search usage is tracked separately from normal token usage in the
[`usage`](https://claudette.answer.ai/core.html#usage) statistics:

``` python
chat.use
```

    In: 10381; Out: 207; Cache create: 0; Cache read: 0; Total Tokens: 10588; Search: 1

Web search requests have their own pricing. As of May 2024, web searches
cost $10 per 1,000 requests.

## Text Editor Tool

Claudette provides support for Anthropic’s special Text Editor Tool,
which allows Claude to view and modify files directly. Unlike regular
function-calling tools, the text editor tool uses a predefined schema
built into Claude’s model.

Important notes about the text editor tool:

- It’s schema-less - you provide a configuration but not a schema
- It uses type identifiers like “text_editor_20250124” specific to
  Claude models
- You must implement a dispatcher function (in Claudette, it’s
  [`str_replace_based_edit_tool`](https://claudette.answer.ai/text_editor.html#str_replace_based_edit_tool))
- Different commands route through this single dispatcher function

The text editor tool allows Claude to:

- View file or directory contents
- Create new files
- Insert text at specific line numbers
- Replace text within files

``` python
from claudette.text_editor import text_editor_conf, str_replace_based_edit_tool
from toolslm.funccall import mk_ns

# Create a chat with the text editor tool
chat = Chat(model, sp='Be concise in your responses.',
            tools=[text_editor_conf['sonnet']], ns=mk_ns(str_replace_based_edit_tool))

# Now Claude can explore files
for o in chat.toolloop('Please explain concisely what my _quarto.yml does. Use your tools, and explain before each usage what you are doing.'):
    if not isinstance(o,dict): display(o)
```

I’ll help you understand what your \_quarto.yml file does. Let me first
locate and read the file.

## Summary of your \_quarto.yml

This Quarto configuration file sets up a **documentation website**
(likely for the claudette Python package) with the following features:

**Project Settings:** - Generates a website from your notebooks -
Includes all `.txt` files as resources - Preview server runs on port
3000 without auto-opening browser

**HTML Styling:** - Uses the “cosmo” theme with custom CSS from
`styles.css` - Enables table of contents, code tools, and syntax
highlighting (arrow style) - Custom layout: 180px sidebar, 1800px body,
150px margins - Blue left border (#31BAE9) on code blocks - Keeps
markdown files after rendering

**Website Features:** - Social media cards (Twitter & Open Graph) for
sharing - GitHub issue links in navbar - Primary-colored navbar with
search - Floating sidebar style

**Additional Config:** - Imports settings from `nbdev.yml` and
`sidebar.yml` files

This is a typical **nbdev** setup for generating documentation from
Jupyter notebooks with a modern, wide-layout design.

## Other model providers

You can also use 3rd party providers of Anthropic models, as shown here.

### Amazon Bedrock

These are the models available through Bedrock:

``` python
models_aws
```

To use them, call `AnthropicBedrock` with your access details, and pass
that to [`Client`](https://claudette.answer.ai/core.html#client):

``` python
from anthropic import AnthropicBedrock
```

``` python
ab = AnthropicBedrock(
    aws_access_key=os.environ['AWS_ACCESS_KEY'],
    aws_secret_key=os.environ['AWS_SECRET_KEY'],
)
client = Client(models_aws[-1], ab)
```

Now create your [`Chat`](https://claudette.answer.ai/core.html#chat)
object passing this client to the `cli` parameter – and from then on,
everything is identical to the previous examples.

``` python
chat = Chat(cli=client)
chat("I'm Jeremy")
```

### Google Vertex

These are the models available through Vertex:

``` python
models_goog
```

To use them, call `AnthropicVertex` with your access details, and pass
that to [`Client`](https://claudette.answer.ai/core.html#client):

``` python
from anthropic import AnthropicVertex
import google.auth
```

``` python
# project_id = google.auth.default()[1]
# gv = AnthropicVertex(project_id=project_id, region="us-east5")
# client = Client(models_goog[-1], gv)
```

``` python
chat = Chat(cli=client)
chat("I'm Jeremy")
```
